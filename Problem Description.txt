Application may have transient spikes. (Hence we weight the previous inputs by a factor delta)

Given N networks with K parameters
Given R requirement parameters of the network

Find the networks satisfying the Requirement Critera 0.9*R + 0.1*R'
Take the Absolute difference between the criterias and the Parameter.
Sum them up with respect to the weights assigned to each parameter.

The final resulting Value is the reward obtained by the agent

Goal:
Selecting a Network that selects the best _efficient_ network basing on the requirement parameters


Possible parameters:
Network Uptime
Network Response Time
Packet Loss
Latency
Bandwidth Utilization
Error Rate
Downtime
Slow response times
Packet loss and latency
Security risks
Reliability

Parameters being Used:
Latency  --- Milliseconds (0 to 1000+)
Bandwidth Utilization --- (Bandwidth of the Network Selected - Actual Being used/Bandwidth of the network) * 100
Available Bandwidth --- (Bandwidth of the Network Selected in MB)
Signal Strength --- Measured in Decibles
Price --- (Cost per GB)

Create an Equation with the Above Parameters
